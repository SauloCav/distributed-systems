## Java Socket Programming

Socket programming establishes communication between two computers on a network. Socket communication utilizes two protocols:

- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): This is a connectionless protocol. It is mainly used to establish a low latency connection between two nodes.
- Transport control protocol (TCP): This is a connection-oriented protocol. It is used to establish a connection between two nodes.
